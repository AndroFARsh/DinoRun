# DinoRun

This project is a recreation of the popular game Dino Run, created solely for academic purposes.

The basic project architecture was inspired by the service-based game architecture provided by the <a href="https://lms.k-syndicate.school/">K-Syndicate School</a>. Moreover, in the project, I employ a simple MVP pattern, which I use to control the UI, and an entity-component system pattern for the gameplay logic.

Additionally, I utilize VContainer for resolving dependencies. Also, I use the Addressable as a resource management system.
